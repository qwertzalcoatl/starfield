# Game Dev Experiment

Quick notes on my 4-hour AI game dev experiment:

- Tried to make a game using only AI prompts
- Based on old space shooter games I played as a kid
- Took about 4 hours of back-and-forth with AI

## What I made:

- Space combat game
- You vs AI opponent
- Shoot torpedoes, fire lasers
- Manage shields
- Cool galaxy background and skahe effects (AI came up with this!)

## How to play:

- Arrow keys to move
- Space for torpedoes
- Shift for lasers
- Keyboard only, no mobile support
